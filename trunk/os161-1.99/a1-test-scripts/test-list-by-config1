# This list runs one test at a time from the commands file (.cmds)
# on all specified configurations before moving on to the command/test
# in the .cmds file.
# This may be preferred when marking because and/or debugging
# because you see a command/test run across multiple configurations
# and each configuration should give approximately similar results.

# Run each test in uw1.cmds on all configurations
# before moving to the next.
