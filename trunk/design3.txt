9. No structure is used to manage swap file. We used an array of boolean that checks if sectors in swap file
  are occupied or not by page table entries. Since each page table entries hold unique index of swap file, no
  other info is required. We also applied synchronization since swap file is a shared resource. It's located
  in physical memory and only one swap file exists. Hence, we need sychronization when reading from swap file or
  write to swap file to prevent any possible errors over the shared resource.
