# Changelog: changed runtest to runtests

# NOTE: These scripts use the csh.
# NOTE: They require the PATH in your .cshrc
# NOTE: to be set correctly so that commands like
# NOTE: sys161 will be found.

# First run to set things up
make

# Then run
make runtests

# Note that this may take some time (~30 minutes on my laptop)
# Also note that this displays all output to the screen but does
# not capture it to a file. You can use a pipe and the "tee" command 
# to print output to the screen and capture it in a file
# (in this case named OUT).
# Assuming you are using the csh or tcsh.
make runtests |& tee OUT

# The | "pipes" the output to the "tee" command to split the output
# to stdout and the specified file "OUT".
# The & (ampersand) redirects stdout and stderr to the pipe.

# If you are using sh or bash use
make runtests 2>&1 | tee OUT

# The 2>&1 | redirects stderr and stdout to the pipe

# make runtests calls ./run-batch
# ./run-batch currently calls

# Each .cmds file contains a list of commands
# that are to be run by the kernel
# E.g., a command is uw1, sy1, tt1, tt2, etc.

# The test below runs each of tests in catmouse.cmds one at a time
# across all the configuration files specified.
# E.g.,
# 1st test in catmouse.cmds on specified configurations
# 2nd test in catmouse.cmds on specified configurations
# ...
./run-on-configs catmouse.cmds sys161-512K-1P.conf sys161-512K-4P.conf

# The default configuration file (sys161.conf)
# will be used if no configuration files are specified. E.g.,:
./run-on-configs catmouse.cmds
